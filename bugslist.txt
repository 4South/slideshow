Conditionally redirect on successful login IF current route is the indexroute
create user login/creation shit in header
CSS for Editing forms on rightbar do not fit small monitors
can mongo NOT produce the massive-sized ids?
PURGE THE BULLSHIT from the repo and consider pushing to master
perhaps move current master to ...legacy or w/e

add some kind of information to the slideshow splash page (perhaps a form to optionally rename, author info, creation date, etc)
Consider adding some additional information to the form fr initial slideshow creation (picture/eventname/bleheblehbleheblheblhe)

Display slideshow name in the header when you are viewing a route in slideshows/*

If a account creation attempt fails because there is a user by that name or email by that name already then the user needs much clearer feedback

similarly, for login failures, wrong passwords, etc all these things need clear feedback

account creation is a route that is optional (available from the navbar)
when you create an account, you should be re-directed back to the page you were previously on (if possible)

something about the list of slideshows needs to change but not yet sure what.  Formatting/style...needs some visual contrast


BUGS
User's must actually "own" the slides as far as the backend is concerned
When you delete a slide, the newly targetted slide is targetted but it is not highlighted correctly

CSS on mainlogin page is not quite right
CSS for Editing forms on rightbar do not fit small monitors

when refreshing on a specific slide, no activeslide is set...bummer

Conditionally redirect on successful login IF current route is the indexroute

add some kind of information to the slideshow splash page (perhaps a form to optionally rename, author info, creation date, etc)
Consider adding some additional information to the form fr initial slideshow creation (picture/eventname/bleheblehbleheblheblhe)

Cannot navigate to slideshows from a specific slideshow

Display slideshow name in the header when you are viewing a route in slideshows/*

When you are inside a slideshow there is no way to navigate to the list of shows or back to the user/login panel
THIS IS CAUSED BY A RENDERING ISSUE.  It works if you navigate to the page but not on reload

Edit Slides button should indicate that this includes creation (somehow)

Edit slide box should not appear until there is a slide selected

on slideshow/:id/slides on reload rightsidebar buttons do not reload
on reload, specific slides do not reload

going back from a slideshow's slides to slideshow does not properly re-render

If a account creation attempt fails because there is a user by that name or email by that name already then the user needs much clearer feedback

similarly, for login failures, wrong passwords, etc all these things need clear feedback

account creation is a route that is optional (available from the navbar)
when you create an account, you should be re-directed back to the page you were previously on (if possible)

indexroute redirects to slideshows

something about the list of slideshows needs to change but not yet sure what.  Formatting/style...needs some visual contrast

Up and Down buttons are broken

When you delete a slide, the newly targetted slide is targetted but it is not highlighted correctly

highlighting....how does it work

When you delete an intermediate slide, the navigation buttons and highlighting gets fucked

Edit slides should force you into slide mode and target the currently active slide.  Is not poissible if there are no slides
